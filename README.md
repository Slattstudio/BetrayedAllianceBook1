# Betrayed Alliance: Book 1
Betrayed Alliance is a fanmade DOS-based game with classic handmade EGA pixel art and type parser interface.

This is part one of a planned trilogy of games. The game itself is free to download and play, so I hope this small labor of love can bring a little nostalgic joy to you!
