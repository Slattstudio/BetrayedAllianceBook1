# Betrayed Alliance: Book 1
Betrayed Alliance is a fanmade DOS-based game with classic handmade EGA pixel art and type parser interface.
This is part one of a planned trilogy of games. The game itself is free to download and play, so I hope this small labor of love can bring a little nostalgic joy to you!
It is a free fan-made SCI0 adventure game, developed by Ryan Slattery (a.k.a. Slattstudio) using Brian Provinciano's SCI Studio 3 and Phil Fortier's SCI Companion.
The game has undergone a huge Kickstarter-funded update featuring new artwork, music and sound.
