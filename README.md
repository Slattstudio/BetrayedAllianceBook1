# Betrayed Alliance: Book 1
Betrayed Alliance is a fanmade DOS-based game with classic handmade EGA pixel art and type-parser interface.

Book 1 is the first installment of a planned trilogy of games, each expanding on the world, characters, and story.

Betrayed Alliance: Book 1 is free to download and play, so I hope this small labor of love can bring a little nostalgic joy to you!

This Sierra-style SCI0 adventure game is developed by Ryan Slattery (a.k.a. Slattstudio) using Brian Provinciano's SCI Studio 3 and Phil Fortier's SCI Companion.
