# v1.3.2 Release Notes:

## Important Notice about Save Files:
**Save games you made with version 1.3.1 will NOT work in 1.3.2. We're sorry, but there is nothing we can do about this. It's the nature of how saved games work in SCI. It might load and look like it works, but in the end, the game will crash when you run into any of the changes that were made.**

### Notable changes:
•    The 1-puzzle point tied to the dart board minigame no longer requires a game win, just challenging the sailor at all.
•    The circuit-board puzzle now gives feedback to the player when they place certain pieces next to each other.
•    "Searching" has been added to certain places where looking inside or through things is likely.
•    Auto-guided stairs and hills can now be reversed if triggered on accident.
### Small changes:
•    Misspellings have been fixed.
•    Bugs involving broken game actions, priority discrepancies, and added parser commands for better playability have been fixed or added.

### Itinerary of Long-Term Fixes:
There are some fixes/additions that will take some time to do and we'll shoot for those at a later update. These are more ambitious goals that we couldn't get out the door in just a few weeks:
•    Optimizing the game for era hardware
•    Creating a better darts minigame from the ground up
•    Making keyboard-only gameplay possible
•    Adding support for all additional sound drivers
