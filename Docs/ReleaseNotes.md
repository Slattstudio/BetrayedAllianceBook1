# Release Notes:
The time has come! Thanks to the Kickstarter backers and Patreon legends Book 1 of Betrayed Alliance has received a massive overhaul!

## Music and Sound:
Before this new version (1.3.1), all the music and sound was done using a windows-based program that ran alongside the game and made use of mp3s.

This caused many problems, not least of which was that any players emulating the game on Linux, Mac, or using era hardware had no sound! There were also many audio bugs and glitches that often made the experience less-than-optimal.

The 1.3.1 version now uses the sound resources proper to SCI0 giving the game that much more authenticity, with the added bonus of removing all the previously stated bugs and allowing sound to work across all platforms.

Brandon Blume was at the helm for the music and sound overhaul and all the original songs in the previous version were orchestrated and new compositions were created for the songs that had been using borrowed free-to-use music.

The 1.3.1 version currently supports the following sound drivers: Adlib, Soundblaster, and MT-32. Future updates will unlock further drivers and the goal is to ultimately support all sound drivers Sierra supported for their releases. To run the game with MT-32 sound you will need an MT-32 or a working emulator.

## Artwork:
Fifth of the fifty-six backgrounds were updated and, in most cases, completely redone from the ground up!

Most of these updates were completed by Karl Dupéré-Richer with a handful done by Ryan Slattery.

In addition to backgrounds being reworked, many items and animations have also received updating as well.

## Features and extras:
While care was taken not to change important features or puzzles in the game to keep its essence the same, players familiar with the previous versions will notice a few changes and added features:

- Some puzzles now may have additional possible solutions, so always be willing to try new ideas and search your surroundings for clues.
- One puzzle has been retrofitted and updated to better fit with future narratives of the series.
- A toggleable autosave and retry function has been added to game.
- New dialog and scenarios have been added.
- The puzzle point amount has changed from 125 to 150 to make room for additional side content and updated puzzle structures.
- Prominent bugs and issues have been fixed.
