# v1.3.3 Release Notes:

### Important Save File Notice!
**Save games you made with any previous version of Book 1 will NOT work in v1.3.3!**

We're sorry, but there is nothing we can do about this. It's the nature of how saved games work in SCI. It might load and look like it works, but in the end, the game will crash when you run into any of the changes that were made.
